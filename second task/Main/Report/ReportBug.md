# Bug Report
**Title:** Input Validation Error for Phone Number Field

**Description:** When entering a phone number, the application should prevent users from entering any characters other than numeric digits. However, the input validation is not functioning as expected, allowing characters to be entered without triggering an error message.

**Expected Behavior:** Users should not be able to input any non-numeric characters in the phone number field. If a user attempts to do so, an error message should be displayed, indicating that only numeric input is allowed.

**Actual Behavior:** The application does not restrict input to numeric values. Users can enter characters freely, and no error message is presented.

**Severity:** High

**Steps to Reproduce:**

Open the application.
Navigate to the phone number input field.
Attempt to enter a non-numeric character (e.g., "A" or "!").
Observe that the input is accepted without any validation error.
Test Case Reference: A test case has been created using Selenium to verify this functionality, and the pseudo-code is available for review.

**Recommendation:** Review the input validation logic for the phone number field to ensure that it correctly restricts input to numeric digits only. Implement appropriate error messaging to enhance user experience.
