***What are these tasks about?**  Writing Test Scenarios for the samin System and Performing Assigned Tasks Regarding Testing the Registration and Login Pages

# About first Task
"In this project, I created Gherkin scenarios to enhance the user experience for the Additional Information tab, focusing on collecting essential profile details. The primary objective was to ensure that users can effectively complete their profile information by addressing various aspects such as affiliations with other brokerages, past regulatory issues, board membership, changes in ownership, registration as a financial entity, and any debts to banks. Each scenario outlines the specific user interactions required for completing these fields, facilitating a smooth data entry process."

# About scond Task
Created a Registration Scenario:

I wrote a test scenario for a hypothetical login and registration page that was assigned to me for testing.
Checked Registration Steps:

Verified the process of filling out the registration form, which includes providing an email, first name, last name, birthdate, phone number, and password.
Handled Validation Errors:

Tested how the system behaves when password confirmation does not match and when a non-numeric value is entered in the phone number field.
Automated the Scenario Using Selenium:

Implemented the registration scenario using Selenium to automate the process and check for expected behavior.

I wrote the scenario with Gherkin, then wrote the steps, and then executed the main scenario itself with Selenium.
